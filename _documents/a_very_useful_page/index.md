# A Very Useful Page

Hi there! This page has all kinds of useful stuff!

## Expense Tracking Form

If you have an approved expense that you need to log for reimbursement, you will need to log the expense and upload a receipt. Here's how!

* Start by going to our [Expense Logger Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfdVvlUsoXh54CBYH85OzP6HsxDYaR-PaTnV2LEn95CSNOyCg/viewform)
* Enter all the details of your expense and submit the form.
* When the form is submitted, you'll see a link to our [Receipt Uploader](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbxh7zs3Re4hxDgdB1-ppbQ_6-HUmqKz_TuNnXhvOzTSSOlA3E6C/exec?folder%3Dlibertine&sa=D&ust=1540153682873000&usg=AFQjCNFCcPBWAfb2wyjCniIlGOexNc4glA). Click that! ![receipt uploader](/images/receipt_uploader.png){: .right-image }
* Now you'll see a form that looks like the image on the right. Click the top button to select a photo or take a picture if you're on your phone, then in the middle box enter the store and price, then click the bottom button. When the page says "All Done" at the bottom, you are all done!
* You'll get a reimbursement when your expense is approved!
